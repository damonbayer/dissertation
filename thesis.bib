  author   = "Faulkner, James R and Minin, Vladimir N",
  abstract = "We present a locally adaptive nonparametric curve fitting method
              that operates within a fully Bayesian framework. This method uses
              shrinkage priors to induce sparsity in order-k differences in the
              latent trend function, providing a combination of local
              adaptation and global control. Using a scale mixture of normals
              representation of shrinkage priors, we make explicit connections
              between our method and kth order Gaussian Markov random field
              smoothing. We call the resulting processes shrinkage prior Markov
              random fields (SPMRFs). We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to
              approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters
              because this method provides superior performance in the presence
              of the high dimensionality and strong parameter correlations
              exhibited by our models. We compare the performance of three
              prior formulations using simulated data and find the horseshoe
              prior provides the best compromise between bias and precision. We
              apply SPMRF models to two benchmark data examples frequently used
              to test nonparametric methods. We find that this method is
              flexible enough to accommodate a variety of data generating
              models and offers the adaptive properties and computational
              tractability to make it a useful addition to the Bayesian
              nonparametric toolbox.",

               Surge in Southern and {West-Central} {USA}",

  abstract  = "In the wake of the rapid surge in the COVID-19-infected cases
               seen in Southern and West-Central USA in the period of June-July
               2020, there is an urgent need to develop robust, data-driven
               models to quantify the effect which early reopening had on the
               infected case count increase. In particular, it is imperative to
               address the question: How many infected cases could have been
               prevented, had the worst affected states not reopened early? To
               address this question, we have developed a novel COVID-19 model
               by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a
               neural network module. The model decomposes the contribution of
               quarantine strength to the infection time series, allowing us to
               quantify the role of quarantine control and the associated
               reopening policies in the US states which showed a major surge
               in infections. We show that the upsurge in the infected cases
               seen in these states is strongly corelated with a drop in the
               quarantine/lockdown strength diagnosed by our model. Further,
               our results demonstrate that in the event of a stricter lockdown
               without early reopening, the number of active infected cases
               recorded on 14 July could have been reduced by more than in all
               states considered, with the actual number of infections reduced
               being more than for the states of Florida and Texas. As we
               continue our fight against COVID-19, our proposed model can be
               used as a valuable asset to simulate the effect of several
               reopening strategies on the infected count evolution, for any
               region under consideration.",

    abstract = { As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks. }

Transmissibility can be measured by the reproduction number R, the average number of secondary cases caused by an infected individual. Several methods have been proposed to estimate R over the course of an epidemic; however, they are usually difficult to implement for people without a strong background in statistical modeling. Here, we present a ready-to-use tool for estimating R from incidence time series, which is implemented in popular software including Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington). This tool produces novel, statistically robust analytical estimates of R and incorporates uncertainty in the distribution of the serial interval (the time between the onset of symptoms in a primary case and the onset of symptoms in secondary cases). We applied the method to 5 historical outbreaks; the resulting estimates of R are consistent with those presented in the literature. This tool should help epidemiologists quantify temporal changes in the transmission intensity of future epidemics by using surveillance data.}",

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated wastewater-based surveillance, allowing public health to track the epidemic by monitoring the concentration of the genetic fingerprints of SARS-CoV-2 shed in wastewater by infected individuals. Wastewater-based surveillance for COVID-19 is still in its infancy. In particular, the quantitative link between clinical cases observed through traditional surveillance and the signals from viral concentrations in wastewater is still developing and hampers interpretation of the data and actionable public-health decisions. We present a modelling framework that includes both SARS-CoV-2 transmission at the population level and the fate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA particles in the sewage system after faecal shedding by infected persons in the population. Using our mechanistic representation of the combined clinical/wastewater system, we perform exploratory simulations to quantify the effect of surveillance effectiveness, public-health interventions and vaccination on the discordance between clinical and wastewater signals. We also apply our model to surveillance data from three Canadian cities to provide wastewater-informed estimates for the actual prevalence, the effective reproduction number and incidence forecasts. We find that wastewater-based surveillance, paired with this model, can complement clinical surveillance by supporting the estimation of key epidemiological metrics and hence better triangulate the state of an epidemic using this alternative data source.}

As sequence data have become more abundant, these approaches are beginning to be used on populations undergoing rapid and rather complex dynamics. In such cases, the simple demographic models that current phylodynamic methods employ can be limiting. First, these models are not ideal for yielding biological insight into the processes that drive the dynamics of the populations of interest. Second, these models differ in form from mechanistic and often stochastic population dynamic models that are currently widely used when fitting models to time series data. As such, their use does not allow for both genealogical data and time series data to be considered in tandem when conducting inference. Here, we present a flexible statistical framework for phylodynamic inference that goes beyond these current limitations. The framework we present employs a recently developed method known as particle MCMC to fit stochastic, nonlinear mechanistic models for complex population dynamics to gene genealogies and time series data in a Bayesian framework. We demonstrate our approach using a nonlinear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model for the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease and show through simulations that it provides accurate estimates of past disease dynamics and key epidemiological parameters from genealogies with or without accompanying time series data.},

One way to accomplish this task formulates an observed sequence data likelihood exploiting a coalescent model for the sampled individuals‚Äô genealogy and then integrating over all possible genealogies via Monte Carlo or, less efficiently, by conditioning on one genealogy estimated from the sequence data. However, when analyzing sequences sampled serially through time, current methods implicitly assume either that sampling times are fixed deterministically by the data collection protocol or that their distribution does not depend on the size of the population. Through simulation, we first show that, when sampling times do probabilistically depend on effective population size, estimation methods may be systematically biased. To correct for this deficiency, we propose a new model that explicitly accounts for preferential sampling by modeling the sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process dependent on effective population size. We demonstrate that in the presence of preferential sampling our new model not only reduces bias, but also improves estimation precision. Finally, we compare the performance of the currently used phylodynamic methods with our proposed model through clinically-relevant, seasonal human influenza examples.},

Unlike other fields of medical research, such as clinical trials and systematic reviews, no reporting guidelines exist for reporting epidemic forecasting and prediction research despite their utility. We therefore developed the EPIFORGE checklist, a guideline for standardized reporting of epidemic forecasting research.   Methods and findings We developed this checklist using a best-practice process for development of reporting guidelines, involving a Delphi process and broad consultation with an international panel of infectious disease modelers and model end users. The objectives of these guidelines are to improve the consistency, reproducibility, comparability, and quality of epidemic forecasting reporting. The guidelines are not designed to advise scientists on how to perform epidemic forecasting and prediction research, but rather to serve as a standard for reporting critical methodological details of such studies.   Conclusions These guidelines have been submitted to the EQUATOR network, in addition to hosting by other dedicated webpages to facilitate feedback and journal endorsement.},

Rogan and Gladen (1978) described a method to estimate the true prevalence correcting for sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic procedure, and Reiczigel et al. (2010) provided exact confidence intervals for the true prevalence assuming sensitivity and specificity were known. In this paper we propose a new method to construct approximate confidence intervals for the true prevalence when sensitivity and specificity are estimated from independent samples. To improve coverage we applied an adjustment similar to that described in Agresti and Coull (1998). According to an extensive simulation study the new confidence intervals maintain the nominal level fairly well even for sample sizes as small as 30; minimum coverage is above 88\%, 93\%, and 98\% at nominal 90\%, 95\%, and 99\%, respectively. We illustrate the advantages of the proposed method with real-life applications.}

abstract = {Summary When testing for a rare disease, prevalence estimates can be highly sensitive to uncertainty in the specificity and sensitivity of the test. Bayesian inference is a natural way to propagate these uncertainties, with hierarchical modelling capturing variation in these parameters across experiments. Another concern is the people in the sample not being representative of the general population. Statistical adjustment cannot without strong assumptions correct for selection bias in an opt-in sample, but multilevel regression and post-stratification can at least adjust for known differences between the sample and the population. We demonstrate hierarchical regression and post-stratification models with code in Stan and discuss their application to a controversial recent study of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in a sample of people from the Stanford University area. Wide posterior intervals make it impossible to evaluate the quantitative claims of that study regarding the number of unreported infections. For future studies, the methods described here should facilitate more accurate estimates of disease prevalence from imperfect tests performed on non-representative samples.},

abstract = {R√©sum√© Il est courant, en inf√©rence fr√©quentielle, d'utiliser un point unique (une estimation ponctuelle) ou un intervalle (intervalle de confiance) dans le but d'estimer un param√®tre d'int√©r^t. Une question tr√®s simple se pose: peut-on √©galement utiliser, dans le m√™me but, et dans la m√™me optique fr√©quentielle, √† la fa√ßon dont les Bay√©siens utilisent une loi a posteriori, une distribution de probabilit√©? La r√©ponse est affirmative, et les distributions de confiance apparaissent comme un choix naturel dans ce contexte. Le concept de distribution de confiance a une longue histoire, longtemps associ√©e, √† tort, aux th√©ories d'inf√©rence fiducielle, ce qui a compromis son d√©veloppement dans l'optique fr√©quentielle. Les distributions de confiance ont r√©cemment attir√© un regain d'int√©r√™t, et plusieurs r√©sultats ont mis en √©vidence leur potentiel consid√©rable en tant qu'outil inf√©rentiel. Cet article pr√©sente une d√©finition moderne du concept, et examine les ses √©volutions r√©centes. Il aborde les m√©thodes d'inf√©rence, les probl√®mes d'optimalit√©, et les applications. A la lumi√®re de ces nouveaux d√©veloppements, le concept de distribution de confiance englobe et unifie un large √©ventail de cas particuliers, depuis les exemples param√©triques r√©guliers (distributions fiducielles), les lois de r√©√©chantillonnage, les p-valeurs et les fonctions de vraisemblance normalis√©es jusqu'aux a priori et posteriori bay√©siens. La discussion est enti√®rement men√©e d'un point de vue fr√©quentiel, et met l'accent sur les applications dans lesquelles les solutions fr√©quentielles sont inexistantes ou d'une application difficile. Bien que nous attirions √©galement l'attention sur les similitudes et les diff√©rences que pr√©sentent les approches fr√©quentielle, fiducielle, et Bay√©sienne, notre intention n'est pas de rouvrir un d√©bat philosophique qui dure depuis pr√®s de deux cents ans. Nous esp√©rons bien au contraire contribuer √† combler le foss√© qui existe entre les diff√©rents points de vue.},
